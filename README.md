# Introduction
CubeSats are a class of nanosatellites with a standardized form factor and size. The typical CubeSat size is based on a "one unit" or "1U," which measures 10x10x10 cm. CubeSats can be expanded to larger sizes such as 1.5U, 2U, 3U, 6U, and even 12U. Initially developed in 1999 as a platform for education and space exploration by Stanford University and California Polytechnic State University at San Luis Obispo (Cal Poly), CubeSats have evolved into their own industry with ever-increasing capabilities. Today, CubeSats provide an affordable platform for scientific research, innovative technology showcases, and sophisticated mission ideas utilizing constellations, swarms, and disassembled systems.


In addition to infrared imaging, we plan to incorporate automatic solar panel and antenna deployment features. By doing so, we aim to boost India's presence in CubeSat technology and advance our understanding of space. In recent years, the proliferation of CubeSats has heralded a new era in space exploration, democratizing access to the cosmos and enabling innovative scientific missions on a smaller scale. Among the diverse range of applications for CubeSats, their potential in infrared (IR) imaging and sensor data transmission stands out prominently.

# Project Overview
This project aims to develop an Indian CubeSat specifically tailored for infrared imaging and sensor data transmission, marking a significant stride in the nation's space endeavors. The choice of IR technology for the CubeSat's payload is informed by its unique capabilities and wide-ranging applications. IR imaging enables the detection and characterization of objects based on their thermal emissions, offering valuable insights across various domains, including environmental monitoring, agriculture, and disaster management. By integrating IR sensors into a CubeSat platform, the mission aims to unlock new possibilities for Earth observation and data-driven decision-making.

# Mission Objectives
Infrared Imaging: Capture Infrared (IR) images of space to provide valuable insights into celestial bodies, space phenomena, and thermal properties of objects in space. These images can aid in the study of exoplanets, nebulae, and other astronomical phenomena.
Sensor Data Collection: Equip the CubeSat with a suite of sensors to collect data, including temperatures inside and outside the satellite, electromagnetic fields, and various electronic data. This data will enable scientists to study the space environment, monitor the satellite's health, and gather crucial information for future missions.
Solar Panel and Antenna Deployment: Incorporate automatic solar panel and antenna deployment features to enhance the CubeSat's energy efficiency and communication capabilities. This technology will ensure that the satellite can effectively gather and transmit data, even in remote or challenging space environments.
Design Philosophy
Central to the CubeSat's design philosophy is modularity and miniaturization, key characteristics that distinguish CubeSats from traditional satellites. The compact size and standardized form factor of CubeSats allow for rapid development and deployment, reducing costs and lead times associated with conventional space missions. Moreover, modularity enables flexibility in payload configurations, facilitating the integration of diverse sensors and instruments tailored to specific mission objectives.
